A responsive web project, making the hometown website responsive 

I did the followings to make this website responsive: 
* Designed with "mobile first" in mind, making sure only include essentials
* Created a hamburger menu. It shows when the width is less than 460px
* Used CSS BEM (Block, Element, Modifier methodology) : http://getbem.com/introduction/
